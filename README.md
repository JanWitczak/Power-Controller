# Power Controller

This is a mod for game RimWorld by Ludeon Studios.

## Description

This mod makes fuelled power plants automatically throttle their power output to keep power production at desired surplus, and keep the batteries charged. The fuel consumption rate is adjusted proportionally. The throttle can also be set manually.

Settings allow to set the desired network surplus,
The tolerance,
The minimal throttle,
And weather the batteries should be kept charged, or ignored.

## Performance
The mod has minimal impact on performance.

## Compatibility
The mod automatically patches buildings with "CompPowerPlant", this should cover the vast majority of custom fueled power plants, and all that can be included as-is.

Additionally, there is a compatibility patch included for:
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power,
- Vanilla Helixien Gas Expanded,
- Rimefeller,
- Save Our Ship 2.

The mod is currently incompatibile with any other mod that at runtime alters a building's power output, such as with a linkable.

## Savefile safety
The mod makes no permanent changes to a save file.
It can be added to an existing game, and shouldn't cause any issues if removed.
